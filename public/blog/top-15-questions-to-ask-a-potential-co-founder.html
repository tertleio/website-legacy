          Finding the Right Co-Founder is Hard
        </h2>
        <p>
          There are many reasons why startups might fail. One of those reasons
          that isn't uncommon is founder breakups - therefore, following a
          consistent co-founder dating process is critical to the success of
          multi-founder startups.
        </p>

        <p>
          Asking the right questions early on can help quickly identify a
          mismatch and prevent butting heads after the fact.
        </p>

        <p>
          I've put together a succinct list of the questions that I like to ask
          my potential co-founders. The key thing to keep in mind here is to be
          consistent, so when it comes to evaluation (which you can find later
          in this post), it's easier to accurately compare and contrast the
          answers. Feel free to cherry pick or reframe the questions as you see
          fit.
        </p>

        <p>
          You'll notice there is no skills section as I'll be following up with
          a blog post dedicated to just that - and its also something we can
          help you with by using Tertle co-founder matching. ;)

          If you're a serial co-founder dater, I would advise putting these in a
          form and sending it to them if you're short on time. Otherwise, I'd
          advise asking them in-person 1 to 1 to get the best answers in real
          time while taking notes.
        </p>

        <p>
          Also, if you haven't already, I would advise answering these questions
          or your own version of these questions yourself first. Again, this
          will help with being methodical when it comes to cross evaluating the
          answers.

      <p>
        It's quite rare to meet your ideal co-founder on your first rodeo and
        there is no such thing as the perfect co-founder or perfect person. The
        goal should be for their strengths to compliment your weaknesses.
      </p>

      <p>
        Figure out which areas are dealbreakers and which ones can be overcome
        or worked on and repeat the process until you find the right fit. Good
        luck, fellow founders!
