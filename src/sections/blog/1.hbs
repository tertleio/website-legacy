        <h2 class="h3">Finding the Right Co-Founder is Hard</h2>
        <p>
          There are many reasons why startups might fail. One of those reasons
          that isn't uncommon is founder breakups - therefore, following a
          consistent co-founder dating process is critical to the success of
          multi-founder startups.
        </p>

        <p>
          Asking the right questions early on can help quickly identify a
          mismatch and prevent butting heads after the fact.
        </p>

        <p>
          I've put together a succinct list of the questions that I like to ask
          when searching for potential co-founders. The key thing to keep in
          mind here is to be consistent, so when it comes to evaluation (which
          you can find later in this post), it's easier to accurately compare
          and contrast the answers. Feel free to cherry pick or reframe the
          questions as you see fit.
        </p>

        <p>
          You'll notice there is no skills section as I'll be following up with
          a blog post dedicated to just that - and its also something we can
          help you with by using Tertle co-founder matching. ;)

          If you're short on time, I would advise putting these in a form and
          sending it to them or using the template which you can find later in
          this post. Otherwise, I'd advise asking them in-person 1 to 1 to get
          the best answers in real time while taking notes.
        </p>

        <p>
          Also, if you haven't already, make sure to answer these questions or
          your own version of these questions yourself first. Again, this will
          help with being methodical when it comes to cross evaluating the
          answers. Share your answers with your partner(s) in turn.

        In Summary
      </h2>
      <p>
        It's quite rare to meet your ideal co-founder on your first rodeo and
        there is no such thing as the perfect co-founder or perfect person. The
        goal should be for their strengths to compliment your weaknesses and
        vice versa.
      </p>

      <p>
        Figure out which areas are dealbreakers and which ones can be overcome
        or worked on and repeat the process until you find the right fit. Good
        luck, fellow founders!
      </p>
